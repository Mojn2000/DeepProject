####  README FOR PROJECT IN DEEP LEARNING ####
PROJECT NAME:
Anomaly detection in time series data using autoencoders.

STUDENTS: 
Ida B. Villesen (s174385), Mads E. Hansen (s174434)

DESCRIPTION:
Use cheaply avaiable data from rental cars (specifically accelerometer info) to detect poor roads.

CODE VERSIONS:
1_1 -> AE, Bi-directional RNN (GRU)
1_3 -> AE, Uni-directional RNN (GRU)
2_0 -> Supervised, Uni-directional RNN (GRU)

NB:
We used ~1gb of data. It is not possible to upload files larger than 25mb to a free github.
